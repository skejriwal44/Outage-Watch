### Outage Forecasting

This repository contains the code for the outage forecasting using Outage Watch: Early Prediction of Outages using Extreme Event Regularizer

The directory consists of :

**model**: This folder contains the proposed BiLSTM -MDN + Classifier model and the baseline ablation models.

### Detail:
1. This code is a sample boilerplate with limited dataset due to constraints outlined in Section 11.
2. Running the scripts will produce results with the sample dataset only.
3. Certain parts of the code that are not applicable to the sample dataset have been excluded, such as the alert-based extreme event label filtering and EVL loss parameters.
4. This repository contains python files for the classifier, MDN, and MTL code and their respective main.ipynb notebooks for execution.
5. A more comprehensive version of the code and sample datasets can be provided after legal evaluations and upon acceptance.
